- Hi, I’m @j-k-s.
- I’m interested in information security; designing and maintaining secure systems; using risk as a tool to focus security effort.
- I’m currently learning to code; primarily python, plus some web front-end fundamentals (html, js, css).
- I'm planning to build a proof-of-concept web app as a learning exercise.
